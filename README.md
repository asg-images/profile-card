Profile card template from Frontend Mentor.io


This is a personal project to build a profile card template from Frontend Mentor.io.

I have recently begun to learn HTMLS & CSS and beginning to learn Javascript, I am going to try and do regular projects like these to recap the skills I have learnt from either tutorials or researching online.

I have recently been using Brad Traversy Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) on Udemy. Which personally I think is a great course.

I have also used other youtube tutorials and code camp etc to learn the basics of HTML & CSS, I feel I have a good understanding of how to use it, but I would now like to start building some projects myself without following tutorials.

My end goal is to eventually be able to pursue a career in web development and I am very aware this will take a lot of commitment and hard work.
